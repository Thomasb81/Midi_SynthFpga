uart_tx.v - UART transmitter, 8-bit, no parity, 1 stop bit, with integral 16-byte FIFO 
            buffer. Occupies 18 slices.

uart_rx.v - UART receiver, 8-bit, no parity, 1 stop bit, with integral 16-byte FIFO buffer.
            Occupies 22 slices.

kcuart_tx.v - UART transmitter, 8-bit, no parity, 1 stop bit.
              Can be used standalone, but typically used as part of uart_tx.v.

kcuart_rx.v - UART receiver, 8-bit, no parity, 1 stop bit.
              Can be used standalone, but typically used as part of uart_rx.v.

bbfifo_16x8.v - A 16 byte synchronous FIFO buffer occupying 8 slices.
                Used in uart_tx and uart_rx, but also useful standalone.


Potential synthesis issues
--------------------------

The HDL supplied for the KCPSM3 macro and the HDL generated by the assembler
(derived from the ROM_form templates) has been written to be suitable for both
synthesis and simulation.

In order for a simulator to have the correct information, the code includes 'INIT'
values defined using 'generic map' statements for each primitive component.
Synthesis tools also require the 'INIT' values to be defined, but in this case the
definition is performed using a separate 'attribute' statements'. The synthesis tool
must then be instructed to ignore the 'generic map' information which is achieved
using meta command directives. Unfortunately, there is no real standard for these
directives and different synthesis tools will expect slightly different syntax.

The supplied HDL has been written using the directives '--synthesis translate_off'
and '--synthesis translate_on' and can be seen in the code as shown in this example:-

  t_state_lut: LUT1
  --synthesis translate_off
    generic map (INIT => X"1")
  --synthesis translate_on
  port map( I0 => t_state,
             O => not_t_state );

If your synthesis tool reports any issues with processing the 'INIT' values declared
as part of the 'generic map' statements then it is not ignoring these lines as intended.
In this case you should globally replace the directives in the 'kcpsm3' and
'ROM_form' files to match the requirements of your synthesis tool. The syntax
variants of this meta command directive encountered by the author are as follows:-

--translate_off                --translate_on
--synthesis translate_off      --synthesis translate_on
--synopsys translate_off       --synopsys translate_on
--pragma translate_off         --pragma translate_on

XST is able to interpret all of the above variants so '--synthesis translate_off'
and '--synthesis translate_on' have been used in the supplied code because it is
the most frequently acceptable variant by other synthesis tools.



XST in ISE v7.1i - WARNING:Xst:2185
-----------------------------------

With this release, XST was given the ability to interpret INIT values contained in
generic maps and this should ultimately avoid the requirement to have separate INIT
attributes and generic maps.

Unfortunately, this enhancement now results in XST producing numerous warning messages
of the type 'WARNING:Xst:2185' which report a "Possible simulation mismatch". Although 
these can be safely ignored (and filtered) it is appreciated that they are less than
desirable.

It is hoped that the KCPSM3 code can be supplied in a modified form in the near future.
However, until it is confirmed that changes to coding style are correctly interpreted
by the tools from all leading HDL synthesis and simulation vendors this will not be
possible. I hope you can understand my position in this respect and will be patient for
a return to a truly clean solution once again.

How to filter this message.

In Project navigator -> Edit -> Message Filters...
    Check the box next to 'Filter enabled' and then save using File -> Save

Now return to your project and run XST again and when you return to the message filters
window you will find that all the warning messages have appeared in the lower half of the
screen.

Move any one of the XST 2185 messages into the top window (Click once on message to select
it and then click and drag it to the top window).

In the top window, select the box under 'Filter Text' and right click to choose the 'Delete'
option. This will change the text to read "blank" line "blank": Possible... etc. Now this one
filter will remove all of the 2185 warnings in one go.

Save the changes with File -> Save.

Now when running XST all of the 2185 messages will have been removed.
